1. Write a utility to accept any number from user and print it's table.
-> p1.sh -> 
	echo enter a number 
	read m
	i=1
	while[ $i -ne 11]
	  do
		echo $i * $m
		i=$((i+1))
	  done
		
2. Write a utility to print numbers 15 to 20 using for loop.
-> p2.sh->
	for i in 15 16 17 18 19 20
	   do
	      echo $i
	   done

3. Write a utility to print numbers from 1 to 5 using until loop.
-> p3.sh -> 
	i=1
	until [ $i -eq 6]
	  do
	    echo $i
          done


4. Write a utility to print first 10 odd numbers using until loop.
-> p4.sh ->
	i=1
	until [ $i -eq 11 ]
	  do
	    echo $i
	    i=$((i+2))
	  done

5. Accept the number from user and if the number is positive find the factorial. Give proper message.
Write a shell utility for above problem.
-> p5.sh -> echo enter the number 
	    read m
	    if [ $m -gt 0 ]
	     then 
             i=1 
	     fact=1
             while [ $i -le $m ]
	        do
		 fact=$((fact * i))
		 i=$((i+1))
		done
	     echo $fact
	    else
		echo please enter positive intiger only
	     fi


6. Write a utility to accept 2 numbers, m and n  from user. Utility should print all even nos starting from
    m till n. Also it should print the count of numbers.
    e.g m=5 n=15
    0/p : 6 8 10 12  14
    count : 5
-> p6.sh -> 
	echo Enter 2 number
	read m n
	count=0
	while [ $m -le $n]
	do
	  if [ $((m%2)) -eq 0]
	  then 
	      echo $m
	      m=$((m+1))
	      count = $((count+1))
	  else
	       m=$((m+1))
          fi
         done
	 echo $count

7. Write a utility to accept number from user and check if it is prime.
-> p7.sh->
	echo enter a number 
	read m
	i=1
	count=0
	while [ $i -le m ]
	do
	  if [ $((m%i )) -eq 0]
	  then 
	      count=$(count+1)
	  fi
	i=$((i+1))
        done
	if[ $count -eq 2]
	then
	    echo The number is prime
	else
            echo The number is not prime
	done

8. Write a utility to delete all empty files from your directory.
-> p8.sh -> 
	for i in $ls
	do
	  if [ find . -type f -name "$i" -empty ]
	  then 
	      rm $i
	  fi
  	done

9. Write a utility to move all the files of size more than 0 bytes to another directory. Make sure that directory is already existing.
-> p9.sh ->
	for i in $ls
	do
	  if[



10. Accept a number n from the user. Write a utility to print n odd numbers and print.
-> p10.sh -> 
	echo Enter a number 
	read m
	i=1
	while [ $m

11. Display contents of all the files in your current directory. Script should display the name of file and then it's contents. If it is directory, propermessage should be displayed.
